    <h1>Journal About Why Davy Want to be a NetRuuner so badly</h1>
    <h2>1. About Games</h2>
    <p> This has a lot to do with my life, I'm going to suppress my strong intentions to tell my life stories, because
        OBVIOUSLY I enjoy sharing it.</p>
    <p> I loved to play video games when I was young, it was a means for me to avoid thinking about all the dramas and
        miseries. While the others were playing League Of Legend. I started to play games like Subnautica, in fact,
        Subnautica is the first game I've played that triggered me so much. Subnautica was describing a BIG story about
        a crash on a new plant 4546B, where you are the sole survivor, and you are trying to figure out why your mother
        ship has been shot down the sky. Along the way, you find a lot of beautiful bios and scary deep ocean. You find
        horrible creatures and beautiful Menta Rays.</p>
    <p> I loved these games, from Subnautica, then GTA5, Later Tomb Raider, and lastly: Cyberpunk2077. Although the
        games I've play before Are really really good, this one is nothing like what I've ever played. By playing it, I
        discovered my belief for this new world--A world of chaos, a world of neon light pollutions, a world of wastes,
        a world of damned souls, a world of longliness.</p>
    <h2>2. About Cyberpunk2077</h2>
    <p> The word "Cyberpunk" came from an anti-utopian si-fi book(at least as I recall it), it's a world full of chromes
        holograms, and other really advanced technology. Medical is unreasonablly high, people who's rich are always
        getting richer, people who are poor are always poor, neon lights covered the moon, advanced weapons overwhelmed
        the city, and people are always sad.</p>
    <p> Skyscrapers standing high, holograms beaconed through the sky, makes everyone can hardly see the stars. Beneath
        the skyscrapers are hectares of recidential district, with much less height compare to the skyscrapers. All
        these houses are taking a lot of space, and yet the gaps between them are small, as if a starving people's belly
        to their back. AC machines hunging outside with all sorts of wires, looked messy. Compared to the corpo
        skyscrapers, the houses were just like beggars, poor and pityful.</p>
    <p> The neighberhood is cold and moist, people go through these puddles over and over agian, with neon lights
        shining through the puddles. Advertisements around corner is displaying sexualized ads, the poor are controled
        by the rich by their matrices of "entertainments". Miles away in the penthouse, rich are enjoying swaying and
        imerging. They control the city, and they can control every single thing in the city. One poor's life is less
        than a fox fur in their opinion. Only few people in the world use their chromes and their networking
        skills(NetRunners) are fighting the corpes with their best yet incompatible strength.</p>
    <p> It's a world of combination of low lives and high-tech. High comtrast of high-tech and moldering world. Full of
        rebeling and abandonment</p>
    <h2>3. About NetRunner in Cyberpunk</h2>
    <p> NetRunners are a series of people who are really good with nerotech and great hacking skills. They hack the
        corpos and get grey-accets for their living. They hate this world, they want to do something about this world by
        expoit the corpos as much as they can.</p>
    <p> Me personally I played as a NetRunner in Cyberpunk2077, I hack people, I hack into their chromes and bioms. And
        I constantly hack into corpo computers, and got a lot of infos about them and I used them against them.</p>
    <p> Speaking of NetRunners and Cyberpunk2077, I have to mention a character appeared in Cyberpunk2077 EdgeRunners:
        Lucy. She's beautiful, and I love her. She and the main character David are doing dirty works, and they rely on
        each other, it's like this concept of although we are fucked up people, but we have each other, and that's
        plenty.</p>
    <h2>4. NetRuuners and me</h2>
    <p> I've always loved hackers in all the movies and literatures. From the movie matrix, to Cyberpunk2077, I loved
        this stealthy yet cool occupation. So I really want to be one. I reckon everything in cyberpunk2077 is ongoing
        and the world is going to exactly be like that, and I want the world to be like that. To be honest the only
        reason of that, is that I think I'll do fine in a world like that. I want to feel this feeling of even though
        everthing is fucked up, I at least still have something important.</p>
    <p> I'm the type of person who really enjoys abusing myself. So from about two years ago, I hate this strong wish
        that I want to be a NetRunner, and do stuff that no one else can or dare to do.</p>
    <h2>5. What my goal is(Generally)</h2>
    <p> I want to be able to hack people and do all the cool stuff. I want to be able to hack people easily and with
        style. And in order to do that, I'll have to excel at this. I want to learn JavaScript, BashScript, Python3,
        HTML, CSS, I want to know everything about computers, so that I can excel.</p>
